# iDash

IDash is a corporate / business dashboard app made from scratch without templates using the next technologies:

* Vuetify, a Vue UI Library with Material Design Components.
* Random User Generator API, to generate users to fill the app.
* LocalStorage in order to save the changes in your browser.

By now, there are only some options and features available, but I will develop more changes and fixes with future versions and updates.
